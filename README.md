# Financial-and-Macroeconomic-Time-Series

This repository analyzes properties of financial and macroeconomic time series. I test the random walk hypothesis using autocorrelation co-efficients test, Portmanteau test, variance ratios and the unit root test Augmented Dickey-Fuller. I also test the normality for each macro series.
